# MCP Server Architecture Overview

Model Context Protocol (MCP) servers follow a client-server architecture where:

- **Server**: Provides resources, tools, and prompts to clients
- **Client**: Consumes server capabilities to enhance AI model interactions
- **Transport Layer**: Handles communication between client and server

## Key Components

1. **Resource Handlers**: Manage access to external data sources
2. **Tool Handlers**: Provide callable functions for clients
3. **Prompt Templates**: Offer reusable prompt structures

## Communication Flow

```
Client Request → Transport → Server → Handler → Response
```

This architecture enables modular, scalable AI assistance systems.
