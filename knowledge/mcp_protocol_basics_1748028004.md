# MCP Protocol Basics

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) defines standard interfaces for AI model interactions.

## Core Concepts

- **Resources**: Static or dynamic data sources
- **Tools**: Functions that can be called by AI models
- **Prompts**: Templates for common interaction patterns

## Protocol Features

- JSON-RPC based communication
- Capability negotiation
- Error handling and recovery
- Streaming support for large data

## Benefits

- Standardized AI model interactions
- Improved security through controlled access
- Enhanced collaboration between AI systems
